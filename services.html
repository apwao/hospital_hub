      <ul>
        <li><strong>Liquid</strong></li>
        <p>The active part of the medicine is combined with a liquid to make it easier to take or better absorbed. A liquid may also be called a ‘mixture’, ‘solution’ or ‘syrup’. Many common liquids are now available without any added colouring or sugar.</p>
        <li><strong>Tablet</strong></li>
        <p>The active ingredient is combined with another substance and pressed into a round or oval solid shape. There are different types of tablet. Soluble or dispersible tablets can safely be dissolved in water.</p>
        <li><strong>Capsules</strong></li>
        <p>The active part of the medicine is contained inside a plastic shell that dissolves slowly in the stomach. Some capsules can be taken apart so the contents can be mixed with a favourite food. Others need to be swallowed whole so the medicine is not absorbed until the stomach acid breaks down the capsule shell.</p>
        <li><strong>Injections</strong></li>
        <p>There are various types of injection, differing in how and where it is injected. Subcutaneous or SC injections are given just under the surface of the skin. Intramuscular or IM injections are given into a muscle. Intrathecal injections are given into the fluid around the spinal cord. Intravenous or IV injections are given into a vein. Some injections can be given at home but most are given at your doctor’s surgery (GP) or in hospital.</p>
